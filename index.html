          <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company
             that specializes in consumer electronics, computer software, and 
             online services. Apple is the world's largest technology company
              by revenue (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's
              st valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC vendor by 
              unit sales, and fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five 
              American information technology companies, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
               and Facebook.
            Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop
             and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak
             s Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, 
             grew quickly. They went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few
             ars, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such 
             as the original Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed advert "1984". 
             However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems
             s did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably, 
             while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.
            As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple 
            lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on 
            Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio, who prepared the struggling 
            company for eventual success with extensive reforms, product focus and layoffs in 
            his 500 day tenure. In 1997, Gil bought NeXT, to resolve Apple's unsuccessful OS 
            strategy and bring back Steve Jobs, who replaced Amelio as CEO later that year. 
            Apple returned to profitability under the revitalizing "Think different" campaign,
             launching the iMac and iPod, opening a retail chain of Apple Stores in 2001, 
             and acquiring numerous companies to broaden their software portfolio. In 2007,
              the company launched the iPhone to critical acclaim and financial success. In
               2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and died two months later.
                He was succeeded by Tim Cook.
            In August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at
             over $1 trillion and the first valued over $2 trillion two years later. It has a high
              level of brand loyalty and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand; as of
               January 2021, there are 1.65 billion Apple products in use worldwide. However, the
                company receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its
                 contractors, its environmental practices, and business ethics, including 
                 anti-competitive behavior, and materials sourcing.</p>
          <p>iPhone
            The first-generation iPhone, 3G, 4, 5, 5C and 5S to scale.
            At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated iPhone,
             a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.\The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, 
             for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract. On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of storage, in 
             addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.\ It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular phone with features found in handheld
              devices, running a scaled-down version of OS X (dubbed iPhone OS after the launch and later renamed to iOS), with various Mac OS X 
              applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch 
              (89 mm) touchscreen display
              , Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").</p>
