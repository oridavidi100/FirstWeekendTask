          <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company
             that specializes in consumer electronics, computer software, and 
             online services. Apple is the world's largest technology company
              by revenue (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's
              st valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC vendor by 
              unit sales, and fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five 
              American information technology companies, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
               and Facebook.
            Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop
             and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak
             s Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, 
             grew quickly. They went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few
             ars, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such 
             as the original Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed advert "1984". 
             However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems
             s did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably, 
             while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.
            As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple 
            lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on 
            Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio, who prepared the struggling 
            company for eventual success with extensive reforms, product focus and layoffs in 
            his 500 day tenure. In 1997, Gil bought NeXT, to resolve Apple's unsuccessful OS 
            strategy and bring back Steve Jobs, who replaced Amelio as CEO later that year. 
            Apple returned to profitability under the revitalizing "Think different" campaign,
             launching the iMac and iPod, opening a retail chain of Apple Stores in 2001, 
             and acquiring numerous companies to broaden their software portfolio. In 2007,
              the company launched the iPhone to critical acclaim and financial success. In
               2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and died two months later.
                He was succeeded by Tim Cook.
            In August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at
             over $1 trillion and the first valued over $2 trillion two years later. It has a high
              level of brand loyalty and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand; as of
               January 2021, there are 1.65 billion Apple products in use worldwide. However, the
                company receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its
                 contractors, its environmental practices, and business ethics, including 
                 anti-competitive behavior, and materials sourcing.</p>
          <p>iPhone
            The first-generation iPhone, 3G, 4, 5, 5C and 5S to scale.
            At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated iPhone,
             a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.\The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, 
             for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract. On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of storage, in 
             addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.\ It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular phone with features found in handheld
              devices, running a scaled-down version of OS X (dubbed iPhone OS after the launch and later renamed to iOS), with various Mac OS X 
              applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch 
              (89 mm) touchscreen display
              , Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").</p>
          <p>iPad
            On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, 
            the iPad. It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats
             including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing 
             documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch 
             screen. It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing,
              as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts,
               and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or
                synced through the user's computer. AT&T was initially the sole U.S. 
                provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.</p>

            The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device, with the
             shipment of 11.4 million smart watches in the first half of 2015,
              according to analyst firm Canalys.
            The original Apple Watch smartwatch was announced by Tim Cook on September 9,
             2014, being introduced as a product with health and fitness-tracking.It was 
             released on April 24, 2015.</p>
          <p>Apple TV
            Main article: Apple TV
            At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV 
            (Jobs accidentally referred to the device as "iTV", its codename, while on stage), 
            a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with 
            high-definition televisions. The device, running a variant of Mac OS X, links
             up to a user's TV and syncs over the wireless or wired network with one computer's 
             iTunes library and can stream content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally
             corporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component 
             video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[145] On May 30, 2007, a 160
              GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model.[344] A software 
              update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the 
              Apple TV.</p>
          <p>HomePod
            Main article: HomePod
            
            A white HomePod on display
            Apple's first smart speaker, the HomePod was released on February 9, 2018, after being delayed
             from its initial December 2017 release. It features seven tweeters in the base, a 
             four-inch woofer in the top, and six microphones for voice control and acoustic 
             optimization[348][349][350] On September 12, 2018, Apple announced that HomePod is
              adding new features—search by lyrics, set multiple timers, make and receive phone
               calls, Find My iPhone, Siri Shortcuts—and Siri languages.[351] In 2019, Apple, 
               Google, Amazon, and Zigbee Alliance announced a partnership to make smart home
                products work together.[352] The HomePod was discontinued on March 12, 2021, for 
                the company to focus on their more successful HomePod Mini.</p>
          <p>AirTag is a tracking device developed by Apple. AirTag is designed to act as a key finder
            , helping people find personal objects (e.g. keys, bags, apparel, small electronic
             devices, vehicles). To locate lost items, AirTags leverage Apple's crowdsourced Find
              My network, estimated in early 2021 to consist of approximately one billion devices 
              worldwide that detect and anonymously report emitted Bluetooth signals. AirTags are 
              compatible with any iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch device capable of running iOS/iPadOS
               14.5 or later. Using the built-in U1 chip on iPhone 11 (excluding iPhone SE 2nd 
               generation) or later, users can more precisely locate items using UWB 
               (ultra-wideband) technology. AirTag was announced on April 20, 2021, made a
               vailable for pre-order on April 23, and released on April 30.</p>
